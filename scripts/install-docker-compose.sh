# that is, download.docker.com, so, an attacker might be able to modify
# both the packages, and the keyring file, at the same time?
# Indeed, someone else has commented about this, and suggests that the
# public key be available in other ways than only via docker.com:
# https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/849#issuecomment-554721114 )
