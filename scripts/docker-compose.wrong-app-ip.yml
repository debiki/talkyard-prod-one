# Changes the 'app' container IP to the wrong IP [maint_app_ip],  so 'web'
# cannot connect to it. This makes 'web' respond quickly with a status 502,
# which is good when in maintenance mode where we want to show a
# "We're upgrading the server" message â€” instead of 'web' being able to connect
# to 'app'; then it won't respond to the end user until half a minute (?)
# has elapsed.
