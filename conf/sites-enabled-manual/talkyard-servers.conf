## To enable HTTPS:
## In section HTTPS Server Nr 1 below, replace  forum.example.com  with your hostname
## (at 3 places). And comment in that section.
##
## To redirect HTTP to HTTPS:
## Comment out the 'include /etc/nginx/...' lines in the HTTP server (not the HTTPS server).
## Comment in the 'return 302 ...' line.
##
## To add more HTTPS servers:
## Copy the HTTPS Server Nr 1 `server {...}` block to a Nr 2, and remove 'backlog=8192'
## from the listen directive in Nr 2 — otherwise there'll be a "duplicate listen options"
## Nginx error. (The backlog should be the same as net.core.somaxconn in /etc/sysctl.conf,
## namely 8192, set in /opt/talkyard/scripts/prepare-ubuntu.sh  [BACKLGSZ]
## — but one may specify this in only one place; that's why you need to remove it.)
##



## For processors with cache line size 32 bytes, you'll easily run
## into this error:
##   nginx: [emerg] could not build server_names_hash,
##        you should increase server_names_hash_bucket_size
## And the solution is to double the bucket size to 64.
## Docs:
## https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#server_names_hash_bucket_size
## [ty_v1] move to nginx.conf, default to 64, env var to change to 32 or 128.
## (so not everyone needs to read this distracting (?) block of text)
##
#server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;

## HTTPS Server with custom (e.g. wildcard) HTTPS cert

## HTTPS Server with custom HTTPS cert.
## Replace  forum.example.com  with your hostname.
